# Investigate a dataset

This is the second project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree program. The project exposes students to the concept in exploratory data analysis (EDA).


## Aim
-  Gather and analyze a dataset
- Summarize the main characteristics in the dataset
- What are your observations?


**The scope of this project is beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis testing task.**

## To do

- Students are required to choose a dataset from a list of datasets given.
- Perform EDA on the chosen dataset.
- Generate a report of their observations.

My long term goal as a data analyst is to work in the medical field. Hence I have chosen the noshowappointments-kaggle dataset.

## Introduction
 When such scheduled appointments are missed and at a high rate, it puts cost on the clinic in terms of wasted hours for the doctor and staff.
Our goal in this project coordinated by Udacity team in the nanodegree data analyst program is to identify some of these reasons why patients miss an appoitment. We will investigate a dataset of over 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil with focus on the question of whether or not patients attend their appointments. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in the dataset.


## Objective

I chose the no-show-medical appointment data from kaggle. Use the data processing methods to predict the reason for missed medical appointments
